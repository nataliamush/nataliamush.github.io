        <h3> Hello! </h3>
        <p>I’m a geographer interested in how transportation shapes our built environment, and the climate and health consequences of these decisions. I’m interested in using tools from econometrics and causal inference to re-evaluate the impact of past transportation policy and better inform future land-use planning. I aim to make visible the ways in which car dependence shapes people’s lives (beyond time spent in travel).</p>
        <p>            My primary motivation as a researcher is to find and advocate for climate solutions that are globally just, recognizing that the United States has had a disproportionate contribution to global climate change.
